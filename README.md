# Hospital_Management_System
🏥 Hospital Management System
<br>
<br>
## 📑 Project Overview
<br>
The Hospital Management System is a console-based application developed in C++ to manage the core operations of a hospital efficiently. It handles patient records, doctor appointments, ambulance services, nurse and driver details, and more. The system utilizes object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, inheritance, and polymorphism to model real-world hospital scenarios.
<br>
<br>
## ✨ Features<br>
👨‍⚕️ Manage Doctor, Nurse, and Patient profiles.<br>
🚑 Ambulance management for emergency services.<br>
📅 Appointment scheduling between doctors and patients.<br>
🚗 Driver management for ambulance services.<br>
🏥 Hospital record keeping, including available services and staff.<br>
📍 Handle Address and global details of hospital entities.<br>
<br>
## 🛠️ Technologies Used<br>
Language: C++<br>
Concepts: OOP (Classes, Inheritance, Polymorphism), File Handling<br>
Environment: Console-based interface<br>
<br>

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
Clone the repository:<br>
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Hospital_Management_System.git<br>
cd Hospital_Management_System<br>

Compile the project:<br>


g++ main.cpp hospital.cpp doctor.cpp nurse.cpp patient.cpp appointment.cpp ambulance.cpp driver.cpp address.cpp person.cpp global.cpp -o HospitalManagementSystem<br>

Run the executable:<br>

./HospitalManagementSystem<br>
<br><br>
## 🔑 Key OOP Concepts Used<br>
Classes & Objects for real-life entities (Doctor, Patient, Nurse, etc.)<br>
Inheritance to share common properties (Person class)<br>
Polymorphism for method overriding where applicable<br>
File Handling to maintain records persistently<br>

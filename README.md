# Hospital_Management_System
🏥 Hospital Management System
📑 Project Overview
The Hospital Management System is a console-based application developed in C++ to manage the core operations of a hospital efficiently. It handles patient records, doctor appointments, ambulance services, nurse and driver details, and more. The system utilizes object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, inheritance, and polymorphism to model real-world hospital scenarios.

✨ Features
👨‍⚕️ Manage Doctor, Nurse, and Patient profiles.
🚑 Ambulance management for emergency services.
📅 Appointment scheduling between doctors and patients.
🚗 Driver management for ambulance services.
🏥 Hospital record keeping, including available services and staff.
📍 Handle Address and global details of hospital entities.
🛠️ Technologies Used
Language: C++
Concepts: OOP (Classes, Inheritance, Polymorphism), File Handling
Environment: Console-based interface
